# Backlog


- How is deployment done today? The needed artifacts as I see it is the portal and the built files only?

## Book: no phylum level

The book goes kingdom selector → Part (CLASS) → Chapter (ORDER) → Family → Genus →
Species, so the PHYLUM rank is structurally absent. The graph has a `PhylumPanel`
and all 32 animalia phyla carry a description, so those 32 are visible in the
graph only.

Not a slicing bug: `portal/public/data/kingdoms/*/orders/*.json` is rooted at
ORDER, and `book-skeleton.json` is Parts (one per class) → Chapters (one per
order), so neither source contains a phylum to render.

A design call, not a defect — hence here rather than fixed. Options, roughly in
order of effort: fold phyla into the Part title/intro; make a Part per phylum and
demote classes to chapter groupings; or leave it and accept that the book is
class-first. Audited in `docs/graph-vs-book-parity.md`.

## Backfill descriptions so the graph stops falling back to a live Wikipedia fetch

`UnifiedInfoPanel` now prefers the stored `description` over a live REST summary
at every rank that shows prose — species, subspecies, hybrid, family, breed — so
the graph and the book read the same text, and the graph no longer shows whatever
Wikipedia returns *today* while the book shows the stored copy.

The live fetch is kept as a fallback, so nothing goes blank, but that means most
of the tree still renders a network round-trip and the two surfaces can still
disagree wherever storage is empty. What is missing, counted from the built order
files across all kingdoms:

| Rank | stored / total | falls back to live |
|---|---|---|
| SPECIES | 395,061 / 1,204,338 | 809,277 |
| FAMILY | 3,860 / 8,042 | 4,182 |
| SUBSPECIES | 2 / 851 | 849 |
| GENUS | 92,967 / 93,037 | 70 |
| ORDER | 1,047 / 1,100 | 53 |
| BREED | 317 / 321 | 4 |
| HYBRID | 0 / 4 | 4 |

The two worst ranks are cheap and worth doing first: **849 subspecies** (only 2
carry any text) and **4 hybrids** (none do) — a few hundred articles, not a
project. The long tail is the 809k species, which is the same job
`scripts/enrichFromWikipedia.ts` already does for the SQLite mirror, so the real
work is extending that pass to the ranks it currently skips rather than anything
new. Once storage covers a rank, drop the fallback for it.

Subspecies need a trinomial-aware lookup: they are not in `wiki-images.json`
(so `SubspeciesPanel` already falls back to the parent binomial for portraits),
and their Wikipedia articles are rarer than species articles.

## Serve Wikipedia lookups from debbie instead of en.wikipedia.org

Every node without a stored description currently costs a live REST call, which
is the rate limit and the graph/book disagreement waiting to happen. The
enwiki wikitext is *already* mirrored in Postgres on debbie (19M mainspace rows,
38 GB), so a small HTTP lookup service in front of it — the same shape as the
existing `scripts/dbserved.ts` — would cover it, following redirects so
`Pekin` → `American Pekin` the way the breed resolver needs.

Plan, including why running MediaWiki for enwiki is the wrong answer on that box
and why svwiki is the one case where it is not:
`docs/wiki-on-debbie-plan.md`.
